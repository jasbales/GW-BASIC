This is a list of files and what they are:

speed.bas
    Here's a GW-BASIC program that calculates the speed of an object based on user input for distance (in meters) and time (in hours, minutes, and seconds). This program includes error handling to ensure that the user enters valid numbers. If an error occurs, the program will inform the user about the correct format and prompt them to enter the values again.

speed02.bas
    This is an improvement on speed.bas. We replace some of the PRINT statements with INPUT statements to streamline user prompts and input. This approach makes the program cleaner by combining the prompt and input in one line.
    
BMI.bas
    Asks the user for height and weight and then tells them their BMI and if they are underweight, normal weight, or overweight. This program uses the GOTO statement to make up for GW-BASIC's lack of advanced control structures.
